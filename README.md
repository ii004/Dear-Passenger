# Dear Passenger

<p>‘Dear Passenger’ is an innovative application designed to transform the traditional flight safety briefing into an interactive and memorable experience using XR technologies with Meta XR SDK.</p>

<h3>Inspiration</h3>

In 2015, research from the University of New South Wales revealed significant gaps in the effectiveness of traditional pre-flight safety briefings. The study showed that individuals recalled only 32% of information from standard briefings, with recall rates dropping by an average of 4% within two hours. This insight inspired us to reimagine safety briefings using immersive technology to enhance retention and preparedness.

<h3>Features</h3>

- Interactive Learning: Simulates pre-flight safety procedures, including life jacket usage, to enhance memory retention through hands-on experience.
- Mixed Reality Integration: Utilizes the Meta Interaction SDK and passthrough technology to provide a realistic cabin environment.
- Versatile Training: Allows users to practice safety procedures via VR at home or MR on the plane.
- AI-Guided Instructions: Features AI-generated voice guidance to ensure clear and engaging instructions.

<h3>Technologies Used</h3>

- Meta Interaction SDK
- Passthrough Technology
- Blender for 3D modeling and animations
- ChatGPT for script preparation
- ElevenLab for AI voice synthesis

<h3>How It Works</h3>

- Locating the Life Jacket: Highlights the life jacket’s location under the seat.
- Wearing the Life Jacket: Guides the user to place the life jacket over their head and secure the straps.
- Fastening the Straps: Instructs on wrapping and securing the straps around the waist.
- Inflating the Life Jacket: Demonstrates how to pull the toggle to inflate the jacket.

<h3>Challenges</h3>

- Lack of Body Tracking: Overcame the challenge of simulating body-worn equipment in a first-person view without haptic feedback.
- Immersion and Feedback: Addressed the need for more immersive feedback mechanisms beyond visual cues.

<h3>Accomplishments</h3>

- Validated the concept’s feasibility and its potential for adoption by flight operators.
- Developed a working prototype despite having no prior experience in XR technology.
- Applied UX design principles to enhance user interaction and engagement.

<h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>

- Gained proficiency in the Meta SDK and its advanced features.
- Learned the importance of storytelling in creating engaging XR experiences.
- Integrated AI-guided instructions to improve user interaction and comprehension.
